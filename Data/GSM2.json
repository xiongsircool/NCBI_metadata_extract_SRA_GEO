        "2nd internode of Arabidopsis inflorescence stem were collected in a petri dish on ice. 2ml cold isolation buffer (20mM Tris (pH=7.5), 40mM NaCl, 90mM KCl, 2mM EDTA (pH=8.0), 0.5mM EGTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5mM Spermidine, 0.2mM Spermine, 15mM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 0.5mM PMSF, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, #11697498001)) supplemented with 10碌l RiboLock RNase inhibitor (40U/碌L) (ThermoFisher, #EO0381) was added to 2g of stem. Samples were chopped manually on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were collected by centrifuge (1000g, 10min, 4掳C) and gently washed by cold resuspension buffer (same formula as isolation buffer but without Triton X-100) for two times. 300碌l of resuspension buffer supplemented with 10碌g/ml Hoechst 33342 at final concentration and 5碌l RiboLock RNase inhibitor were added to the centrifuged nuclei. 15,000 nuclei were sorted into TRIzol solution as a replicate sample by BD FACSAriaTM IIIu cell sorter using a 70 碌m sort nozzle according to GFP signal level, except for LTP1_GFP+_S21 which was 10,800 nuclei. RNA was extracted into 15 碌l water according to manufacture's protocol.",

        "Further analysis was carried out in R (v3.5.0). GTF file was imported using makeTxDbFromGRanges in GenomicFeatures library (v1.32.3) with drop.stop.codons option. Position of each gene was extracted by genes function, which also includes the intron region. Reads counts per gene were obtained using summarizeOverlaps in GenomicAlignments library (v1.16.0) with mode = \"Union\", ignore.strand = TRUE options. Only genes of Arabidopsis was kept, and GFP reads were added in the last line in rawCounts table for selected samples. bigWig files were generated by bamCoverage in deepTools from bam files.",
