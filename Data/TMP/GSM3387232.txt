!Sample_characteristics_ch1 = genotype: Ler x Col
!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = Material was generated by manually crossing of pistillata (Ler) mutants with pollen of INT line (Col) and the INT line in dde2 background pollinated with Ler.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = All seeds were surface sterilized (70%, 30% ethanol 10min), stratified for 2 days at 4°C and germinated on half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (1% sucrose) in long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h darkness; 21°C). Plants were transferred to soil after 10 to 12 days and grown under long day conditions.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = total RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = For RNA sequencing, endosperm nuclei from seeds derived from indicated crosses were isolated using the INTACT protocol using replicates as indicated. RNA was extracted following a mirVana kit (Ambion). mRNA extraction was performed using NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation kit.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Samples were sequenced at the National Genomic Infrastructure (NGI) from SciLife Laboratory (Uppsala, Sweden) on an Illumina HiSeq2500 in paired-end 125bp read length.
!Sample_description = Arabidopsis thaliana F1-endosperm of Landsberg-0 (female) crossed with Columbia-0 (male)
!Sample_description = ler_x_col_rep1
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were trimmed by removing the 15 bp from the 5’ end and mapped in a single-end mode to the Arabidopsis (TAIR10) genome previously masked for rRNA genes and for the SNP positions between the TAIR10(Col) and the Landsberg (Ler) genome, using using TopHat v2.1.(Trapnell et al, 2009)  (parameters adjusted as -g 1 -a 10 -i 40 -I 5000 -F 0 -r 130).
