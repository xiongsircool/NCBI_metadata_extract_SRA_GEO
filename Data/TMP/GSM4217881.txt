!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Arabidopsis were grown on soil for three weeks in short days (8h light 16h dark, constant 21°C) and then transfered to long days (16h light 8h dark) to stimulate flowering.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 2nd internode of Arabidopsis inflorescence stem were collected in a petri dish on ice. 2ml cold isolation buffer (20mM Tris (pH=7.5), 40mM NaCl, 90mM KCl, 2mM EDTA (pH=8.0), 0.5mM EGTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.5mM Spermidine, 0.2mM Spermine, 15mM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 0.5mM PMSF, cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, #11697498001)) supplemented with 10µl RiboLock RNase inhibitor (40U/µL) (ThermoFisher, #EO0381) was added to 2g of stem. Samples were chopped manually on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were collected by centrifuge (1000g, 10min, 4°C) and gently washed by cold resuspension buffer (same formula as isolation buffer but without Triton X-100) for two times. 300µl of resuspension buffer supplemented with 10µg/ml Hoechst 33342 at final concentration and 5µl RiboLock RNase inhibitor were added to the centrifuged nuclei. 15,000 nuclei were sorted into TRIzol solution as a replicate sample by BD FACSAriaTM IIIu cell sorter using a 70 µm sort nozzle according to GFP signal level, except for LTP1_GFP+_S21 which was 10,800 nuclei. RNA was extracted into 15 µl water according to manufacture's protocol.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 1 µl was used for mRNA-seq library construction by Smart-seq2 protocol (Picelli et al., Nature Methods, 2013; Hofmann et al., Plant Reprod., 2019). NEBNext Ultra II gDNA prep kit with the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina was used for library preparation

!Sample_data_processing = Araport11 gene annotation file was taken (Araport11_GFF3_genes_transposons.201606.gtf).
!Sample_data_processing = FASTQ files were trimmed by Cutadapt (v2.3) using following options -g AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACGGG -a CCCGTACTCTGCGTTGATACCACTGCTT -g AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTAC  -a GTACTCTGCGTTGATACCACTGCTT -b "A 30" -b "T 30 " -n 2 -g AGATCGGAAGAGC -l 50 -m 23 --overlap 5. By these options, oligo sequence used in Smart-seq2 amplification, poly A or T sequence, Illumina adaptor sequence were removed from the reads.
!Sample_data_processing = Trimmed files were then mapped to the genome by STAR (v2.5.0a) using --outFilterMultimapNmax 1 --alignIntronMax 10000 --alignMatesGapMax 10000 --outFilterScoreMinOverLread 0.9 options.
!Sample_data_processing = For GFP reads, GFP sequence was indexed by STAR using –genomeSAindexNbases 4 option, and then reads were mapped using STAR with --alignIntronMax 1 --alignMatesGapMax 1 --outFilterScoreMinOverLread 0.90 options.
!Sample_data_processing = Further analysis was carried out in R (v3.5.0). GTF file was imported using makeTxDbFromGRanges in GenomicFeatures library (v1.32.3) with drop.stop.codons option. Position of each gene was extracted by genes function, which also includes the intron region. Reads counts per gene were obtained using summarizeOverlaps in GenomicAlignments library (v1.16.0) with mode = "Union", ignore.strand = TRUE options. Only genes of Arabidopsis was kept, and GFP reads were added in the last line in rawCounts table for selected samples. bigWig files were generated by bamCoverage in deepTools from bam files.
