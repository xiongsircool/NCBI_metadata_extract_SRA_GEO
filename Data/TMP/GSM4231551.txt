!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = We collected samples of 11 time-points. 11 plates each containing about 80 germinated Arabidopsis seedlings were divided into the acclimated and non-acclimated group. At each sampling time-point from the experimental design (Figure 2.2 A), all leaf tissue from the designated plate was harvested and divided into two separate Eppendorf tubes, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. At day 12 after seed germination, T1 samples were taken right after the start of the photoperiod and before acclimation treatment starts. Plates from acclimated group were exposed to the heat acclimation treatment and samples were taken after 3 h (T2), 6 h (T3) and 7.5 h (T4), while other plates were returned to normal growth conditions and samples were collected two days (T5) and four days (T6) after at 1:30 pm. At day 16, the remaining acclimated and all the non-acclimated plants were exposed to heat shock treatment (45°C for 90 min), and samples were taken before the heat treatment (T7 for acclimated seedlings, T9 for non-acclimated seedlings), at the end of the heat shock (T8 for acclimated seedlings, T10 for non-acclimated seedlings) and two days after the application of heat stress at 1:30pm (T9 for the acclimated seedlings, T11 for non-acclimated seedlings).
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = Plates each containing about 80 Arabidopsis Col-0 seedlings were grown inside growth chamber (Percival) with 22°C under 16h / 8h of light / dark cycle (~100 μmol m−2 s−1) with 60% relative humidity. The acclimation treatment was applied by subjecting plates with Arabidopsis seedlings into the growth chamber (Percival) with the temperature gradually rising from 22C to 45C over the course of 6 hours (starting at the beginning of the photoperiod) in the light and keep at 45C for 90 mins. Subsequently, the plates were transferred back to a growth chamber with standard (22C) temperature. For the heat shock application, the growth chamber (Percival) was pre-heated to 45C with lighting (~100 μmol m−2 s−1) and 60% relative humidity. Each plate containing 80 acclimated or non-acclimated seedlings was transferred from the control growth condition (22C) chamber to a heated growth chamber (45C) for 90 mins from 1:30 pm to 3:00 pm (7.5 - 9h after the beginning of the photoperiod).
