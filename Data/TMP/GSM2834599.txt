!Sample_data_processing = Reads were mapped to the Arabidopsis reference genome (TAIR10) using Tophat version 2.1.0 in default mode with minimum and maxmum intron lengths being set to 10 and 15,000 bp, respectively. The transcript abundance (FPKM) was estimated using Cufflinks (version 2.1.1). Cuffdiff was run using default parameters with inputs of the TAIR10 genome and transcript annotations.
